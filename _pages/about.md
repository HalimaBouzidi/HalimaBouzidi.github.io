Hi! My name is Halima Bouzidi ^^

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Embedded & Cyber-Physical Systems (AICPS) Lab](https://aicps.eng.uci.edu/) at the [University of California, Irvine (UCI)](https://uci.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque](https://aicps.eng.uci.edu/people-2/).

My research stands at the intersection of Multi-objective optimization, Machine Learning (ML), Hardware architectures, Security, and Privacy with an emphasis on resource-constrained intelligent systems. To enhance the performance, efficiency, and reliability of intelligent applications and devices, I develop methods that seamlessly integrate ML, optimization, security, and privacy analysis across both software and hardware levels.

I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Engineering in January 2024 from the [Polytechnic University of Hauts-de-France (UPHF)](https://www.uphf.fr/en) where I was a member of the [the LAMIH lab](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih). I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Smail NIAR](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih/membres/niar_smail), [Prof. El-Ghazali Talbi](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/~talbi/indexf043.html?n=Main.Biography), and [Dr. Hamza Ouarnoughi](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih/membres/ouarnoughi_hamza).

Prior to my PhD program, in September 2020, I graduated with honors from the [Higher school of Computer Science (ESI ex INI)](https://www.esi.dz/en/home/) in Algiers, Algeria, where I received both my Masterâ€™s and Engineering degrees. I was mentored and introduced to embedded systems by [Prof. Mouloud Koudil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mouloud-koudil-3a07ab24/?originalSubdomain=dz) and [Dr. Nassima Kadri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadri-nassima-909588131/).
