### üöÄ Research Focus

**Machine Learning and Security researcher** with 5+ years of experience developing efficient AI systems and adversarial security tools. I specialize in **Secure and Trustworthy AI**, **Adversarial Machine Learning**, and **Edge/Embedded AI** deployment.

My research lives at the **exciting intersection** of:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Machine Learning**: Adversarial ML, Robustness Evaluation, Physical Adversarial Attacks (Acoustic, Optical, Electromagnetic), Red-Teaming of AI Systems, AI for Security
- ü§ñ **Efficient Machine Learning**: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Graph Neural Networks, Edge AI, Energy-Efficiency, Model Compression
- üéØ **Autonomous Systems Security**: Security of Cyber-Physical Systems, Privacy Attacks (Membership Inference, Model Hijacking)
- ÔøΩ **Hardware-Software Co-Design**: Multi-objective optimization, resource-constrained intelligent systems

ÔøΩ **Current Research**: Leading the **AICPS Security Group** investigating emerging threats to autonomous systems, including sensor spoofing and attacks on machine learning models such as LLMs and vision-language-action (VLAMs) models.

üí° **DARPA Collaboration**: Contributing to the DARPA FIRE program (UCI + ASU + HII), developing a cyber-physical exploits knowledge base (SACI-DB) with 90+ vulnerabilities to accelerate red-teaming.

### üéì Academic Journey

I received my PhD degree in Computer Engineering in January 2024 from the [Polytechnic University of Hauts-de-France (UPHF)](https://www.uphf.fr/en). I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Smail Niar](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih/membres/niar_smail), [Prof. El-Ghazali Talbi](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/~talbi/indexf043.html?n=Main.Biography), and [Dr. Hamza Ouarnoughi](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih/membres/ouarnoughi_hamza).

Prior to the start of my PhD program, I graduated with honors from the [Higher school of Computer Science (ESI ex INI)](https://www.esi.dz/en/home/) in Algiers, Algeria, where I received both my Master‚Äôs and Engineering degrees in September 2020. I was mentored and introduced to the world of Embedded Systems by [Prof. Mouloud Koudil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mouloud-koudil-3a07ab24/?originalSubdomain=dz) and [Dr. Nassima Kadri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadri-nassima-909588131/).
